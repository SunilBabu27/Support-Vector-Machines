# Support-Vector-Machines
This segment of code illustrates Support Vector Machine Classification with different kernels using the Iris Dataset
<br>1. Import the Iris dataset and load it. <br>
<br>2. Prepare different SVM classifiers by creating instances of SVM. <br>
<br>3. The different kernels used are: Linear, RBF and Polynomial. <br>
<br>4. For each kernel, fit the data into the model. <br>
<br>5. Plot the decision boundary and results using Color plots and display the differences between the different kernels. <br>
<br>6. For SVM Regression using Linear, polynomial and RBF kernels, generate the sample dataset and add noise to targets. <br>
<br> Fit the regression models and plot the results to visualize the differences between the different kernels<br>
